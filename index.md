## 📌 Abstract
Data centers consume a significant portion of global energy, with cooling systems accounting for 30-40% of total consumption. This paper introduces a **physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL)** framework for optimizing data center cooling. Using a specialized **graph neural network**, our method efficiently learns control policies from limited operational data, achieving **14-21% energy savings** in real-world deployment.
